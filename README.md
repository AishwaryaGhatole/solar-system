# üåå Interactive 3D Solar System

An interactive, 3D Solar System simulation built using **Three.js**.  
Explore the planets, hover to reveal names, control orbital speeds, and enjoy smooth animations.

## Step to run the code in your own Local Machines

1. Once the Zip file is downloaded in your local machines, extract all files.

2. Open the main file with the help of local terminal. (by right clicking on file folder you'll see the option that says
   `open  in Terminal`).

3. After opening the code file in terminal, simply open it with VScode using `code .` command.

4. (assuming you're in Local Terminal/VScode terminal, with the appropriate file path opened) Install node package
   manager by using `npm install`.

5. Once the 4. step is done, you'll see a folder named `node_modules` which has all the dependencies for running the code
   in your local machine.

6. Now, in terminal(any, with the appropriate file path opened) Use command `npm run dev`.

7. You'll see the localhost path link in your terminal.

8. Click on the path while pressing `CTRL` key to get Redirected to the project `Solar System`.
